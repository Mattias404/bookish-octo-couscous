            <p>A computer scientist can find a lot of use in the Student’s Union throughout the week for a wide variety of things. If one has their laptop with them they can find refuge at one of the many cozy seating areas the Student’s Union to power through assignments when the usual work area (the Diamond) is full. For those without laptops one might find a lot more luck in finding a free PC to use than the Diamond. You’ll also find a larger variety in faces because the Student’s Union is for all students rather than the engineers and scientist you might be used to seeing for the majority of the week. </p>
            <p>Like all humans, a computer scientist must eat to sustain a healthy mind to work at the university, luckily the Student’s Union provides a vast amount of eating options for all meals of the day. From a cheeky breakfast sandwich to the various meal deals on offer, you will satisfy your hunger. It’s also great to have a treat so close by after working hard on whatever project one has been working on for the past few hours.</p>
            <p> From monday to friday this might be what a computer scientist prefers to use the Union for (excluding all the random activities that take place throughout and about the SU). The weekend holds just as much attraction as the weekdays because after a busy week a computer scientist might want to take some time to drain all excess energy at the Students Union turned nightclub where you can dance with many students and friends to music carefully selected by a guest DJ.</p>
            <p> Although having a few drinks then hitting the dance floor is very appetising to most, some compsci students prefer being on the other side of the curtain by volunteering to help set up and run the Student Union nightlife. Ranging from lights, sound to advertising and ticket handling, you can have fun helping the party animals have fun.  </p>
