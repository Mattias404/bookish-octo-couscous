            <h1> Eating Options </h1>
            <p>When hungry, the SU becomes a nexus of eating options available to devour, regardless of your preferences/diet. In the heart of the Unions first floor you will find a cafeteria with a multitude of stalls which you can buy food from if you haven’t been offered free food upon entering the SU. The food here ranges from giant pizza slices to custom wraps so you can be assured that you can find something delicious for a good price since it’s designed for students and you can save money using your GeniUS card here for extra points with each item eaten.</p>
            <p>If you feel like having a meal you can consume with a straw you can check out Pearls. This is where you can find some glorious bubble tea rich with antioxidants. The menu is both large in volume and variance with a vast selection of toppings to make your tea feel personal.</p>

            <p>With a name like the Proper Pasty Company, I doubt that this establishment needs much said. Each cornish pasty is made with the most freshest and finest ingredients as well as love because these are made with the hands of  master bakers. They take their time to allow for a large attention to detail to ensure each pasty consumed is immeasurable to anything you could find at bakers and stores run by machines.</p>
